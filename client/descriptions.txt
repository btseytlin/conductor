"This is the world of the day after tomorow.\n Once as powerfull and mighty as corrupted and sinned, the hummanity has driven itself into a dead end.
Since the catastrophe Earth has been populated by terrible creatures, polluted by radiation and other hazards, mostly turned into deserts or dangerous enviroments not yet inspected by mankind. 
\nHumans, as usual, survived. Slowly, year after year, they regained lost pieces of culture and progress. Due to harsh enviroment huge fortresses became the only places where people lived. 
These cities, with their own societies and goverments, covered new continents with a pattern of chaotically placed dots.  
\nMost people never go outside the walls of their city. Because outside there is only death for them. 
\nFor a long time the settlements were completely separated from eachother. But as technology progressed and needs expanded politics started to reappear on desolated lands. 
That produced a high need for a way to transfer information between strongholds. To satisfy that very need a new profession was born."

"\nThe conductors. 
They were the ones, who could cross thousand miles, slipping past all dangers of the new world, from one city to another. All alone. They always do it alone, because a lone man can easily pass somewhere, where even an armed squad would fail. 
\nYou are one of them. You are a Condutor, the only thing that connects cities together and allows for information to transfer. You are armed with a great deal of experience, ability to defend yourself, a steel nerve and knowledge of such things as physics, biology, medicine and many more."
